Every few years the topic of a general speed limit on German highways is subject of controversial discussion: In 2020, 46% of ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club) members were against, while 47% would were in favour of a general speed limit.

- Why is it important: Current day and age, especially in Germany a lot of people have cars and use them (source?) >
